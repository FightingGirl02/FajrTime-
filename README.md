Detecting Fajr Prayer Time

# Fajr Prayer Time Detection System

This project aims to develop a reliable algorithmic system to detect the **earliest Fajr prayer time (Subh Sadiq)** based on astronomical observations, light intensity measurements, and data analysis. It combines principles from Islamic astronomy and modern sensor technology to ensure accurate prayer timings.

## Objective

To design and implement a system that can:
- Detect the **true beginning of Fajr** using SQM.
- Compare the detected time against existing prayer time tables.
- Provide accurate, real-time indicators or logs for Subh Sadiq.
